## ‚ú® Key Features

CityConnect is designed to be the direct line between residents and local government, simplifying the process of reporting non-emergency municipal issues.

* **Responsive Tab Navigation (Vanilla JS):** Seamless switching between Home, About, Features, and FAQ pages without full page reloads.
* **Contrasting UI:** Uses a high-contrast dark-mode theme (`#F5F5F5` and `#C7E8F3` against a dark purple background) for accessibility and visual appeal.
* **Contained Scrolling:** Long content pages (like About and FAQ) are contained within the main component, allowing them to **scroll vertically** without the page layout shifting, ensuring the navigation bar remains fixed.
* **Responsive Design (Mobile-First):** The layout utilizes CSS media queries and flexible units to ensure the entire application adapts gracefully from large desktop screens down to small mobile viewports. The navigation buttons, hero section, and content padding all adjust for an optimal user experience on any device.
* **Clean Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Logic (JavaScript) is cleanly separated from Presentation (CSS) and Structure (HTML).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
