                    We believe that local government works best when it can hear the voices of the people it serves. Our platform is designed to <strong>break down bureaucratic barriers</strong> by providing a single, simple place for citizens to report non-emergency issues like <strong>potholes, street waste, broken lights, and graffiti.</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For the Citizen:</strong> You quickly log an issue with precise location and a photo. No more long phone calls, confusing forms, or searching for the right department.</li>
                    <li><strong>For the Authorities:</strong> CityConnect instantly routes your report to the <strong>correct municipal department</strong> or government agency responsible for fixing that specific problem. This ensures quick acknowledgment and efficient delegation of tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
